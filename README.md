# âš¡ Parallel Quick Sort

Welcome to **Parallel Quick Sort**! This project implements the Quick Sort algorithm in parallel using Java, aimed at improving the sorting performance for large datasets.

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

**Parallel Quick Sort** leverages the power of parallel processing to optimize the traditional Quick Sort algorithm. By utilizing multiple threads, this implementation can sort large arrays more efficiently, making it ideal for high-performance computing tasks.

### Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Enhances sorting speed by using multiple threads.
- **Java Implementation**: Written entirely in Java for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Server-Based**: Includes a Java server for managing sorting requests.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Frontend**: HTML
- **Server**: Java Server

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Software Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: [![Java Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%3E%3D%208-orange)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)

Once you have installed the JDK, you can proceed with compiling and running the project.

- A web server (optional for web interface)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Soham0902/Parallel_Quick_Sort.git
    ```
2. **Compile the Java Code**
    ```sh
    javac ParallelQuickSortServer.java
    ```
3. **Run the Java Server**
    ```sh
    java ParallelQuickSortServer
    ```

### Usage

1. Ensure the Java server is running.
2. Use the provided HTML interface (`index.html`) to send sorting requests to the server.
3. The server will process the request and return the sorted array.
